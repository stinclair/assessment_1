<p>It is hard to contemplate what my ideal job in IT would be right now! I genuinely am taking this one step at a time. And this unit is a start to understating where I want to take my career. </p>
<p>Looking around at IT roles online and looking at my experience the idea of IT Project Management roles does spark interest. I would like to stay in the health care industry. People attracted to working in health care have a genuine care for other people and want to be a part of an industry that makes a difference. I like being around people that have these similar values.</p>

<p>An IT Project Manager role interests me as it would mean working on delivering a specific solution to an area of the business from beginning to end. I like the concept of working through one project and seeing its conclusion and then commencing something new.</p>
<p>To be eligible and ready for a role like this one I would need previous experience in a similar role. Therefore, this role would be something to work towards. I would also need to complete further study in project management. There are project management courses that can be completed through TAFE such as the Diploma of Project Management which I can study online. This role also requires experience in HL7, Rhapsody or FHIR.</p>
<p>From my understanding HL7, Rhapsody and FHIR helps link health IT applications and will make sharing healthcare data more efficient. From my understanding this can be learnt on the job or by further online study.</p>
