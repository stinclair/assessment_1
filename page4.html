<p>After completing the Myers-Briggs personality test, I learnt my personality type is a <b>Defender</b>. A defender personality indicates that I am hard working, devoted and loyal. That I have a can-do, caring personality but that I can be sensitive. It does indicate that although I can be reserved, that I do have people skills and interest in interacting with others in social and work situations.Being a defender means that I am meticulous and have a high standard and high expectations on myself when completing work and goals.</p>
<p>Some of my strengths as a defender are that I am reliable. This means that I care about completing work and ensuring work is competed to a high standard. It also explains that my strengths are supporting others and that I am happy to share my knowledge and work in a team working towards win-win situations.Some of my strengths as a defender are that I am reliable.

<p>Part of my weaknesses are that I may take things too personally. It can mean that I respond well when I am not appreciated. It means that I may feel personally attacked when I receive criticism of if someone disagrees with me. It also describes that I may not respond well to change. Although I feel this to be true in some circumstances, I do feel that responding to change is an aera I have been working on and, in a work sense I embrace an encourage change. Importantly I work closely with my colleagues to look for areas to improve in relation to our system and processes.  Another weakness is that I may mean that I may not feel comfortable to stand up for myself or to address matters where other people arenâ€™t pulling their weight. </p>
<p>After completing an online learning style survey at <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/" target="_blank">https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/</a> it indicates that that my preferred learning style is visual. This can mean that I prefer to learn by seeing text and graphics and graphs. I prefer to be shown how to visually rathe than just being told what to do. It also means I like to highlight important points as I learn them to help with my understanding and memory. A helpful suggestion on my learning style is to take notes and then type my notes up afterwards to help consolidate my understanding.</p>
