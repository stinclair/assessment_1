<p>My IT project idea directly relates to the industry I work in and specifically around medical credentialing. My idea it to establish a state-wide medical credentialing application.</p>
<p>In my varied roles in medical administration across public and private health care, I have encountered varied issues and in particular double workloads across our Victorian health care providers. For example, for junior doctors, they are often employed and/or seconded across several different hospitals in Victoria in one year. The junior doctor is required to submit application individually to each health service and duplicate similar recruitment and onboarding verification checks such as submitting copy of CV, providing certified copy of primary medical qualification, copy of current working with children check card, and certified copies of identification for the purpose of criminal history check. In addition, they usually provide referee details for online reference checks. This means that their supervisors, specialist consultant doctors, are required to complete multiple references for the one junior doctor multiple times in one year. And given they supervisor many junior doctors, this can equate to significant time spent by the specialist completing many online references.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues faced with junior doctor credentialing, I also would like to include state-wide medical credentialing for specialists. This would include state-wide solution to the same issues raised about with junior doctors including reference checking, police checking and verification of documentation. In addition, the specialist credentialing application would have a state-wide scope of practice for each medical speciality. The state-wide scope of practice would first need to be defined by each speciality college. And each health service would have the ability to define their own master scope of practice based on the services they can provide at each of their own sites (if multi-sited) for each speciality. </p>
<p>I envision the state-wide solution (application) to have three separate interface tailored for use by medical workforce units in each health care services and separate user interface for the doctor who require credentialing. And also a separate interface for use by internal hospital representative such as in the operating theatre. </p>
<p>Each health service would have their own sign-in to the application and can tailor some settings to meet organisational requirements. For example, some health services do not require police checks or other documentation for seconded junior doctors whereas some do. </p>
<p>I would also envision this application will integrate with regulatory bodies such as:
<ul>
	<li>Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency</li>
	<li>Department of Justice (Victorian) working with children checks</li>
</ul>
<p>Health care administration users would be able to directly pull information about a doctor and receive regular updates if changes occur. An example would be if the doctor’s medical registration was suspended, or conditions are added or changed.</p>
<p>Key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A doctor would submit their application only once to the state-wide credentialing application and then allow each required health service to access their profile.</li>
<li>Each health service can review the doctor’s profile and if everything was in order, approve the doctor for credentialing at their health service and document the approved scope of practice.</li>
<li>A health care service’s theatre complex can also have a tailored access to the state-wide credentialing application whereby they can easily locate if a doctor is credentialed for their health service and view their approved scope of practice</li>
<li>Junior doctors who require new references each year can submit referee details to the application each year; once completed the reference details can be viewed by the relevant health services when the doctor has enabled access.</li>
<li>The doctor would not be able to view their completed references, these would be expected to be submitted in confidence by the referee.</li> 
<li>The application would be able to communicate important messaging from the health service to the doctor with regards to their credentialing such as confirming when credentialing is current and notifying when credentialing has lapsed</li>
<li>Notifying the doctor of their approved scope of practice</li>
<li>Enable doctors to submit application to vary their scope of practice directly through one application and submit a further required evidence of training or sub-speciality fellowship</li>
</ul>
<p>The state-wide credentialing application would include the profession medical indemnity insurance provision, this is important for doctors who are not employed by the health care service and are required to hold their own professional medical insurance cover</p>
<ul>
<li>The doctor will upload to the application once and allow each health service access to view</li>
<li>It would allow the health service to approve and deny the level of cover provided by the doctor which would impact their credentialing status</li>
<li>Notify the doctor prior to expiry and prompt to upload updated insurance details for review by each health service</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawback to this IT project would be the ability to get all health services on board. </p></ul>
<p>The other obstacles would be relating the scope of practice for specialists. Best practice would be to have each specialty college define the structure of each scope. Obtaining this information from each college would be a challenge. </p>
<p>Other considerations of the design would be to ensure the ability to make changes to a defined scope of practice. As these would be an ever-changing list. </p>
<p>The skills required to develop and deliver this idea would be experienced software developers and experience in health care medical credentialing, in both public and private. As well as skills in integration of data as the project would need to integrate well with other services. </p>
<p>From my research and my current knowledge of medical credentialing there is no other product on the market that can facilitate a state wide credentialing offering. I am aware of company in the past that attempted something similar however I know they were not able to offer a specialist scope of practice. The road block for this would be that every health services has their own unique scope of practice. The complexity of mapping each health services own scope list into a state-wide list would be difficult. My solution as mentioned would be to consult each speciality college to define the scope and build into the application. </p>
<p>If the project were to be successful there would be significant financial savings to health care services in terms of staff resourcing for credentialing as well as reduced costs of police checking. Another benefit would be reduction in time wasted by specialist doctors completing online reference checks for other doctors. Delivering this idea successfully would also result in greater transparency and clarity around where a doctor may hold credentialing and to easily identify the defined scope of practice.</p>
