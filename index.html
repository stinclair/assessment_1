<p> I am Australian born with parents who have a rich mix of nationality including Irish, Indian, Italian, and Scottish. I grew up in Melbourne and after finishing high school I completed two years of further education at TAFE studying office (business) administration.</p>
<p>Since completing further study, I have worked in administration roles in small business such as working as an assistant accountant for a small accounting firm, and an office manager in the textile industry. I then moved on to working in public health care where I have remained for many years. I commenced in payroll and then moved into Human Resources, where I worked in recruitment advertising for several years. While in these roles I completed two Diplomas, Management and Human Resource Management.</p>
<p>I then gravitated towards medical administration specifically with junior doctor recruitment and onboarding in public health. I gained a lot of experience in shortlisting, interviewing, contracting, and onboarding. This role also included supporting other departments with their medical recruitment requirements.  I also had the opportunity to step into leadership roles where I lead a team of four (sometimes more) to meet our annual recruitment onboarding goals and project managed our medical careers expo. My experience in this area led to my next career opportunity and my current role.</p>
<p>I now work in private health but remain in medical administration. I support the medical credentialing system for a large private health care organisation. This system is a web-based Software as a Service (Saas). My role is in-house as a system administrator supported by an external software vendor. I can make local configuration updates and improvements as required by the business. My role also involves supporting all the business users of the software, this includes training and supporting users through process improvement.</p>
<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love spending time out in the sun, on the odd occasion it comes out in Melbourne. I am also a big netball fan. I enjoy watching the domestic super netball league as well as international games. My love for netball comes from playing as a child and for many years after high school, where I had a team with friends.</p>
