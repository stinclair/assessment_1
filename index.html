<p> I am Australian born with parents who have a rich mix of nationality including Irish, Indian, Italian, and Scottish. I grew up in Melbourne and after finishing high school I competed two years of further education at TAFE studying office (business) administration.</p>
<p>Since completing further study, I have worked in administration roles in small business such as working as an assistant accountant for a small accounting firm, and an office manager in the textile industry. I then moved on to working in public health care where I have remained for many years. I commenced in payroll and then moved into Human Resources, where I worked in recruitment advertising for several years. While in these roles I completed two Diplomas, Management and Human Resource Management.</p>
<p>I then gravitated towards medical administration specifically with junior doctor recruitment and onboarding in public health. I gained a lot of experience in shortlisting, interviewing, contracting, and onboarding. This role also included supporting other departments with their medical recruitment requirements.  I also had the opportunity to step into leadership roles where I lead a team of four (sometimes more) to meet our annual recruitment onboarding goals and project managed our medical careers expo. My experience in this area led to my next career opportunity and my current role.</p>
<p>I now work in private health but remain in medical administration. I support the medical credentialing system for a large private health care organisation. This system is a web-based Software as a Service (Saas). My role is in-house as a system administrator supported by an external software vendor. I can make local configuration updates and improvements as required by the business. My role also involves supporting all the business users of the software, this includes training and supporting users through process improvement.</p>
<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I love spending time out in the sun, on the odd occasion it comes out in Melbourne. I am also a big netball fan. I enjoy watching the domestic super netball league as well as international games. My love for netball comes from playing as a child and for many years after high school, where I had a team with friends.</p>
<p>My interest in IT comes from roles at work. My interest started when I have been part of IT projects in the past where software solutions were rolled out to the organisation. My current role as a system administrator has further ignited my interest in IT and a desire to have a better grasp on aspects of IT such as software development and the technical side of my role as system user. In recent discussion with our software vendor about issues with the database and platform issues I have engaged the support of our internal IT department. I would like to add value to my existing role by having a better understanding and knowledge of some of the technical components. I also would like to upskill to improve career opportunities and hopefully move on when the time is right, and I am ready for a new challenge.</p>
<p>I chose to RMIT online as it offers a foundation unit of study that suits what I am looking for in terms of further education. For now, I wish to get a feel for IT and the unit Introduction to IT appeared to be a good fit. I also have not completed university study before! This is a fantastic opportunity for me to have a look around to see if IT suits me and see how studying will fit with my full-time role and familiar obligations.</p>
<p>I expect to gain a good understanding of what constitutes Information Technology. I am hoping that by completing this unit that it will provide direction on further study and in what area.</p>
<p>It is hard to contemplate what my ideal job in IT would be right now! I genuinely am taking this one step at a time. And this unit is a start to understating where I want to take my career. </p>
<p>Looking around at IT roles online and looking at my experience the idea of IT Project Management roles does spark interest. I would like to stay in the health care industry. People attracted to working in health care have a genuine care for other people and want to be a part of an industry that makes a difference. I like being around people that have these similar values.</p>
<p>An IT Project Manager role interests me as it would mean working on delivering a specific solution to an area of the business from beginning to end. I like the concept of working through one project and seeing its conclusion and then commencing something new.</p>
<p>To be eligible and ready for a role like this one I would need previous experience in a similar role. Therefore, this role would be something to work towards. I would also need to complete further study in project management. There are project management courses that can be completed through TAFE such as the Diploma of Project Management which I can study online. This role also requires experience in HL7, Rhapsody or FHIR.</p>
<p>From my understanding HL7, Rhapsody and FHIR helps link health IT applications and will make sharing healthcare data more efficient. From my understanding this can be learnt on the job or by further online study.</p>
<p>After completing the Myers-Briggs personality test, I learnt my personality type is a Defender. A defender personality indicates that I am hard working, devoted and loyal. That I have a can-do, caring personality but that I can be sensitive. It does indicate that although I can be reserved, that I do have people skills and interest in interacting with others in social and work situations.Being a defender means that I am meticulous and have a high standard and high expectations on myself when completing work and goals.</p>
<p>Some of my strengths as a defender are that I am reliable. This means that I care about completing work and ensuring work is competed to a high standard. It also explains that my strengths are supporting others and that I am happy to share my knowledge and work in a team working towards win-win situations.Some of my strengths as a defender are that I am reliable.

It also explains that my strengths are supporting others and that I am happy to share my knowledge and work in a team working towards win-win situations.</p>
<p>Part of my weaknesses are that I may take things too personally. It can mean that I respond well when I am not appreciated. It means that I may feel personally attacked when I receive criticism of if someone disagrees with me. It also describes that I may not respond well to change. Although I feel this to be true in some circumstances, I do feel that responding to change is an aera I have been working on and, in a work sense I embrace an encourage change. Importantly I work closely with my colleagues to look for areas to improve in relation to our system and processes.  Another weakness is that I may mean that I may not feel comfortable to stand up for myself or to address matters where other people aren’t pulling their weight. </p>
<p>After completing an online learning style survey at www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment it indicates that that my preferred learning style is visual. This can mean that I prefer to learn by seeing text and graphics and graphs. I prefer to be shown how to visually rathe than just being told what to do. It also means I like to highlight important points as I learn them to help with my understanding and memory. A helpful suggestion on my learning style is to take notes and then type my notes up afterwards to help consolidate my understanding.</p>
<p>After completing a personality test at The Big Five Personality Test | Truity I learnt it further clarified areas of my personality. The test indicated that I tend to be practical and focus on relevant matters. It also indicated that I am focussed and determined to achieve goals.</p>
<p>My IT project idea directly relates to the industry I work in and specifically around medical credentialing. My idea it to establish a state-wide medical credentialing application.</p>
<p>In my varied roles in medical administration across public and private health care, I have encountered varied issues and in particular double workloads across our Victorian health care providers. For example, for junior doctors, they are often employed and/or seconded across several different hospitals in Victoria in one year. The junior doctor is required to submit application individually to each health service and duplicate similar recruitment and onboarding verification checks such as submitting copy of CV, providing certified copy of primary medical qualification, copy of current working with children check card, and certified copies of identification for the purpose of criminal history check. In addition, they usually provide referee details for online reference checks. This means that their supervisors, specialist consultant doctors, are required to complete multiple references for the one junior doctor multiple times in one year. And given they supervisor many junior doctors, this can equate to significant time spent by the specialist completing many online references.</p>
<p>In addition to the issues faced with junior doctor credentialing, I also would like to include state-wide medical credentialing for specialists. This would include state-wide solution to the same issues raised about with junior doctors including reference checking, police checking and verification of documentation. In addition, the specialist credentialing application would have a state-wide scope of practice for each medical speciality. The state-wide scope of practice would first need to be defined by each speciality college. And each health service would have the ability to define their own master scope of practice based on the services they can provide at each of their own sites (if multi-sited) for each speciality. </p>
<p>I envision the state-wide solution (application) to have three separate interface tailored for use by medical workforce units in each health care services and separate user interface for the doctor who require credentialing. And also a separate interface for use by internal hospital representative such as in the operating theatre. </p>
<p>Each health service would have their own sign-in to the application and can tailor some settings to meet organisational requirements. For example, some health services do not require police checks or other documentation for seconded junior doctors whereas some do. </p>
<p>I would also envision this application will integrate with regulatory bodies such as:
<ul>
	<li>Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency</li>
	<li>Department of Justice (Victorian) working with children checks</li>
</ul>
<p>Health care administration users would be able to directly pull information about a doctor and receive regular updates if changes occur. An example would be if the doctor’s medical registration was suspended, or conditions are added or changed.</p>
<p>Key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A doctor would submit their application only once to the state-wide credentialing application and then allow each required health service to access their profile.</li>
<li>Each health service can review the doctor’s profile and if everything was in order, approve the doctor for credentialing at their health service and document the approved scope of practice.</li>
<li>A health care service’s theatre complex can also have a tailored access to the state-wide credentialing application whereby they can easily locate if a doctor is credentialed for their health service and view their approved scope of practice</li>
<li>Junior doctors who require new references each year can submit referee details to the application each year; once completed the reference details can be viewed by the relevant health services when the doctor has enabled access.</li>
<li>The doctor would not be able to view their completed references, these would be expected to be submitted in confidence by the referee.</li> 
<li>The application would be able to communicate important messaging from the health service to the doctor with regards to their credentialing such as confirming when credentialing is current and notifying when credentialing has lapsed</li>
<li>Notifying the doctor of their approved scope of practice</li>
<li>Enable doctors to submit application to vary their scope of practice directly through one application and submit a further required evidence of training or sub-speciality fellowship</li>
</ul>
<p>The state-wide credentialing application would include the profession medical indemnity insurance provision, this is important for doctors who are not employed by the health care service and are required to hold their own professional medical insurance cover</p>
<ul>
<li>The doctor will upload to the application once and allow each health service access to view</li>
<li>It would allow the health service to approve and deny the level of cover provided by the doctor which would impact their credentialing status</li>
<li>Notify the doctor prior to expiry and prompt to upload updated insurance details for review by each health service</li>
