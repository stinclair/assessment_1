<p>My interest in IT comes from roles at work. My interest started when I have been part of IT projects in the past where software solutions were rolled out to the organisation. My current role as a system administrator has further ignited my interest in IT and a desire to have a better grasp on aspects of IT such as software development and the technical side of my role as system user. In recent discussion with our software vendor about issues with the database and platform issues I have engaged the support of our internal IT department. I would like to add value to my existing role by having a better understanding and knowledge of some of the technical components. I also would like to upskill to improve career opportunities and hopefully move on when the time is right, and I am ready for a new challenge.</p>
<p>I chose RMIT online as it offers a foundation unit of study that suits what I am looking for in terms of further education. For now, I wish to get a feel for IT and the unit Introduction to IT appeared to be a good fit. I also have not completed university study before! This is a fantastic opportunity for me to have a look around to see if IT suits me and see how studying will fit with my full-time role and familiar obligations.</p>
<p>I expect to gain a good understanding of what constitutes Information Technology. I am hoping that by completing this unit that it will provide direction on further study and in what area.</p>
